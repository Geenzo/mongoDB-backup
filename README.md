## Node MongoDB Backup Tool ## 

Project was mostly a test project to experiment with moving large amounts of data around in node.

## Setup ##

```
1. clone repo
2. npm i
3. npm run export / npm run import
```

## Scripts ##

`npm run export` will export all data from a hardcoded connection string into json files in a `backups/{date}` directory

[WIP] ~~`npm run import` will import all backed up data into a hardcoded connection string~~

## Testing ##

Currently no test suite has been implemented.
